                <h2>My Entrepreneurial Projects & Insights</h2>

                <h3>MLByt: Virtual Learning Platform (2023 - Present)</h3>
                [cite_start]<p>As Data Strategist for MLByt, I focused on leveraging data to genuinely enhance student learning outcomes[cite: 11]. [cite_start]The core insight was that raw engagement metrics aren't enough; understanding *why* students interact in certain ways (e.g., getting stuck at specific points, re-watching certain lessons) allowed us to fine-tune content delivery and identify areas for platform improvements[cite: 12, 13]. This direct feedback loop between data and product development was crucial.</p>

                <h3>TeeTeeTales: Social Opinion-Sharing Platform (2021-2023)</h3>
                [cite_start]<p>My role here as Business & Data Analyst involved deep dives into user behavior and sentiment analysis[cite: 16]. The challenge was not just attracting users, but retaining them and fostering meaningful engagement. [cite_start]By understanding user sentiment around specific topics and platform features, we could make data-backed decisions on the product roadmap, significantly boosting retention and overall platform engagement[cite: 17].</p>

                <h3>Hobbytual: Platform for Hobby Enthusiasts (2020-2021)</h3>
                [cite_start]<p>This was a hands-on backend development role where I built RESTful APIs using PHP and optimized workflows with Python[cite: 20, 21]. The key learning here was the importance of a robust, scalable backend, even for niche platforms. Efficient data migration and API design are critical for a smooth user experience and future growth, regardless of the platform's initial size.</p>

                <h3>Pursuing AI Minor at IIT Ropar</h3>
                [cite_start]<p>My current pursuit of a Minor in Artificial Intelligence at IIT Ropar [cite: 36] stems from a conviction that AI will be a transformative force in education and data analysis. I believe that understanding AI's capabilities will allow me to design even more intelligent, adaptive, and impactful learning solutions in the future, bridging my passion for education with cutting-edge technology.</p>
